# Instruction Set Architecture
An Instruction Set Architecture is a way to talk/communicate to the computer processor. The ISA describes the registers and describes each machine-level instruction. The ISA tells exactly what each instruction does and how it is encoded into bits. The ISA forms the interface between hardware and software.
