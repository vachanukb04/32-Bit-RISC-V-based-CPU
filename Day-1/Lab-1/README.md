# Labwork for RISC-V Software toolchain

# Setting up the Environment  -Installation of Worskshop collaterals files

In order to understand RISC-V ISA and work on the implementation, you will need a GNU GCC cross-compiler for RISC-V and a simulator(Here we have used Spike simulator).For all the necessary files(compilers and toolchains) required for the workshop to be installed on your local machine, follow the below instructions:

1. type in the following command in your terminal in the local machine

`$git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals.git`


A basic C program to calculate [sum of natural numbers](https://github.com/vachanukb04/32-Bit-RISC-V-based-CPU/blob/master/CPU%20Code/Sum1toN.c) upto a limit provided by the user.
* Command used to compile the C program is `gcc <filename.c>` or `gcc -o <binary file name> <filename.c>` and to run we use `./a.out` or `./<binary file name>`
